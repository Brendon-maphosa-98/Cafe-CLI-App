Upon a Quit morning
By no grand light did morning start its day,
just pale and slow it crept across the skies. 
No tumpet call, no golden burst display, 
Just muted tones where sleeping silence lies. 

The breeze was soft, it rustled not the trees, 
The world remained in hush, as if in prayer. 
No footsteps stirred, no hum of waking bees, 
Just dew on leaves  and cold, untroubled air. 

A coffee cup in hand, I faced the sun, 
Its light now warming corners of the room. 
No battles fought, no race to start or run-
Just peace that lingered, Shyly, in the gloom. 

So not all dawns must rise with blood inten, 
Some come to heal, not burn, but to relent.
