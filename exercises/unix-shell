## Exercise 1: Navigating Through the File System

1. Open your terminal.

2. Use the `pwd` command to find out where you are. What is the full path of your current directory? Next type in `cd ~`, then again `pwd`, where did this take you?

3. Run the `ls` command. What do you see?

3. Try `ls -l`. How is the output different?

4. Use the `whoami` command. Who are you logged in as?

5. Run the `date` command. What date and time does your system show?

6. Try `date +"%Y-%m-%d"`. What changed?

7. Use `hostname` to find the name of the machine you are working on.

8. Run `echo "Hello, world!"`. What happens? Try changing what is in the quotation marks. 

9. Try to navigate from your home directory to your `books/` folder. Use `pwd`, `ls` and `cd` to help you! 

10. Once in your `books/` directoyry, run `ls`. What do you see?

11. Use `cd fiction` to enter the fiction folder inside books.

12. Run `pwd` to check where you are.

13. Go back to the books folder using `cd ...`

14. Check your location again with `pwd`.

15. Change directory into the 'fiction' folder. Use `cat` to view the contents of one of the files. 

16. Use `cd ..` to go back to your 'books/` directory, type in `cat fiction/story.txt`. Replace story.txt with the name of a story in the fiction section. What does this command do?

17. Take some time navigating through the files and practicing the commands... Have fun! 

## Exercise 2: Working with Files

1. Navigate to your books directory (or any working directory). confirm your location with `pwd`.

2. Create a new directory called `practice`.

3. Move into the `practice` directory.

4. Create an empty file named `notes.txt` using `touch`.

5. Run `ls` to verify that the file was created.

6. Rename `notes.txt` to `summary.txt`

7. Create another file called `draft.txt`

8. Move `draft.txt` into a new directory called `backup`.

9. Check that `draft.txt` is inside backup by listing its contents

10. Copy `summary.txt` into the `backup` folder.

11. Move into the `backup` directory and confirm both files are there.

12. Copy `summary.txt` and rename it to `summary_copy.txt` in the same directory.

13. Verify that `summary_copy.txt` exists using ls

14. Remove `summary_copy.txt`

15. Go back to the practice directory. (use `cd ..`)

16. Try to remove the `backup` directory. What happens? You will need to empty the directory in ord to delete it. 

17. Remove the backup directory and all its contents using `rm -r backup`

18. Verify that backup is gone using `ls`.

19. Type in `clear` to clear your terminal. 

If finished, take some time practicing the commands learned in your own way. The best way to learn is through practice! 

## Exercise 3: Searching

1. Open the books folder.

2. Use less to view the contents of a file in the fiction directory. something like this: 

```bash
less fiction/story.txt
```

Replace story.txt with the story you would like to read. Press `q` to quit. 

3. View the first 10 lines of a file in the books directory. Navigate to a folder and type something like this: 
```bash
head story.txt
```
You could also try: 
```bash
head -n 5 story.txt
```
This shows the first 5 lines of the file. Adjust the number as needed!

4. Use tail to view the last 10 lines of the same file.Write something like this: 

```bash
tail story.txt
```

Try and also adjust the number of lines displayed with tail!

5. Navigate back to your books directory. Search for the word "Lizzy" inside the fiction directory:

```bash
grep "Lizzy" fiction/*
```

Try searching for different words to see what comes up from the different stories!

6. Search case-insensitively for "dark" inside the fiction directory. Change the word as needed to search through the stories.

```bash
grep -i "dark" fiction/*
```

7. Find all .txt files in the fiction folder
```bash
find books -name "*.txt"
```

Take some time to review these commands and research about some of their use cases or options to combine them with. Good luck!
