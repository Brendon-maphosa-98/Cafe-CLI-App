## Project Overview

---

### Scope

The client has launched a pop-up caf√© in a busy business district. They are offering home-made lunches and refreshments to the surrounding offices. As such, they require a software application which helps them to log and track orders.

Each week will cover some of the requirements and look to you to build an app to meet them.

---

### Requirements

As a business:

- I want to maintain a collection of `products` and `couriers`.
- When a customer makes a new `order`, I need to create this on the system.
- I need to be able to update the status of an `order` i.e: `preparing`, `out-for-delivery`, `delivered`.
- When I exit my app, I need all data to be persisted and not lost.
- When I start my app, I need to load all persisted data.
- I need to be sure my app has been tested and proven to work well.
- I need to receive regular software updates.

## Technical Specifications

### User Interface

We will be building a program that runs on the command line (CLI).

- UI should be logical, clear, and simple to navigate.
- It should display a menu of options, some may be nested.
- There should be the option to exit / return to main menu.
- It should handle invalid input.

---

### Data Persistence

We will incrementally adopt three methods to persist data between user sessions:

- `txt`: Initially we'll store our data in plaintext files.
- `csv`: As our data changes shape, we'll need to switch to the CSV format.
- `SQL`: Ultimately, we'll finish up using a database.

---

### Testing

Python has some basic testing functionality built-in which we'll use to test the quality of our code. This will allow us to be confident that our app works as we intended it to.

---

### Data Visualisation

We'll want to build some bar charts to help our client better understand the business. For this we'll use:

`Jupyter Notebooks + Matplotlib`

### Stuck?

Getting stuck on something is not fun for anyone. Due to the size of the group please follow this recommended workflow:

When stuck:

- Don't panic: Relax, take a break, think about the problem.
- Google it: There is a wealth of information on the web and you'll likely find the solution to your problem quite quickly.
- Syntax: If it's a syntax problem try referring to earlier slides, or the official Python Docs / W3 Schools.
- Ask a colleague: Ask someone in the group. It's likely they too have come across and solved your problem.
- Ask your instructor: If all else fails, reach out to your instructor for some guidance.

Notes:
There will be plenty of time to complete the basics of the mini-project.

Remember it's not a race, we want everyone to complete it.
