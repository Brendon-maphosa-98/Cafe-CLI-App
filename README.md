## Project Background  

The goal of this project is to create a **CLI-based cafe management app** with a clear and simple user interface. The app takes relevant inputs, produces meaningful outputs, and ensures that data persists over time.  

The project was developed iteratively, with **weekly client requirements** shaping its growth and complexity.  

---

## Client Requirements  

**Week 1**  
- Create a product and add it to a list  
- View all products  
- Update or delete a product  

**Week 2**  
- Extend functionality to include orders  
- Create, view, update, and delete products or orders  

**Week 3**  
- Add couriers in addition to products and orders  
- Update the status of an order  
- Persist product and courier data to txt files
- Update or delete a product, order, or courier  

**Week 4**  
- Persist **all data** (products, couriers, and orders) to CSV files  
- View orders filtered by **assigned courier** or **order status**  
- Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for products, couriers, and orders

## How to Run the App  
download required packages
$py -m pip install -r requirements.txt

1. Navigate to the **Week 4 App Package** directory:  

   cd mini-project/week4/source/AppPackage_Week4
2. Run the main programe
   python3 masterLoop_module.py
3. Follow the onscreen prompts

## Unit Testing  

Unit tests are located in `test_app.py`.  
Currently, they focus on validating **user input functions**, ensuring that the app handles different types of user input reliably.  

In future, **more robust tests** could be added, including:  
- Integration tests  
- Database persistence tests  
- Automated CLI navigation tests
