☕ Brendon's Cafe Mini Project
📖 Project Background
The goal of this project is to create a CLI-based cafe management app with a clear and simple user interface. The app takes relevant inputs, produces meaningful outputs, and ensures that data persists over time.

The project was developed iteratively, with weekly client requirements shaping its growth and complexity.

✅ Client Requirements
Week 1

Create a product and add it to a list

View all products

Update or delete a product

Week 2

Extend functionality to include orders

Create, view, update, and delete products or orders

Week 3

Add couriers in addition to products and orders

Update the status of an order

Persist product and courier data

Update or delete a product, order, or courier

Week 4

Persist all data (products, couriers, and orders) to CSV files

View orders filtered by assigned courier or order status

Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for products, couriers, and orders

▶️ How to Run the App
Navigate to the Week 4 App Package directory:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd mini-project/week4/source/AppPackage_Week4
Run the main program:

bash
Copy
Edit
python3 masterLoop_module.py
Follow the on-screen prompts in the CLI.

🧪 Unit Testing
Unit tests are located in test_app.py.
Currently, they focus on validating user input functions, ensuring that the app handles different types of user input reliably.

In future, more robust tests could be added, including:

Integration tests

Database persistence tests

Automated CLI navigation tests

💡 Project Reflection
This project has been challenging but highly educational, improving my:

Problem-solving skills

Knowledge of data persistence with CSV files

Ability to manage increasing application complexity

What stood out most was how each new feature introduced unexpected edge cases and errors elsewhere in the code. Managing this while continuously expanding functionality required deliberate debugging and refactoring.

Looking back:

The most tedious aspect was error handling in an evolving codebase.

If I were to start over, I’d lead with TDD (Test Driven Development) to catch errors early and ensure new features didn’t break existing functionality.

I would also implement integration testing alongside unit tests to maintain stability as features grow.

Moving forward:

I plan to migrate from CSV persistence to a database-backed approach for improved scalability.

I would refactor the structure with OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) principles to make the codebase more modular, cleaner, and more maintainable.

🚀 Future Improvements
✅ Code Structure & Modularity

Implement classes for products, couriers, and orders

Create reusable helper modules

✅ Database Integration

Replace CSV persistence with PostgreSQL or SQLite

Add Adminer or similar DB admin tooling for easy management

✅ Testing & Quality

Introduce TDD from the start

Add integration tests for complete workflow validation

Include type hints and static analysis tools

✅ User Experience

Improve CLI menus with color-coded outputs

Add search and filter options for faster data retrieval

✅ Deployment

Dockerize the app for easier setup

Add a lightweight web UI in the future

✨ Key Takeaways
Start with clean architecture to avoid refactoring pains later

TDD helps avoid regression errors when adding new features

Incremental feature development teaches how complexity grows in real apps

Always plan for data persistence strategy before scaling features

Would you like me to:
✅ Add badges (Python version, license, etc.)?
✅ Include example screenshots of CLI menus?
✅ Or even create a table of contents for easy navigation on GitHub?

Should I add those extra touches?
