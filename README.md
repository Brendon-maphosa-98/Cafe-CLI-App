Welcome to Brendon's Cafe Mini Project

Project background
The goal with this project is to create a programme that runs on the CLI for a cafe app that should have a clear, simple user interface that take relevant inputs and gives relevant outputs. The programmes data must over time be able to persist.

Client Requirements
Week 1 - The client requested the app allow them to create a product and add it to a list, view all products and update or delete a product
Week 2 - The client requested the app allow them to create a product or order, and add it to the relevant list, view all products or orders update or delete a product or order
week 3 - The client requested the app allow them to create a product, courier, or order and add it to a list, view all products, couriers, or orders, update the status of an order, persist my data (products and couriers), update or delete a product, order, or courier
week 4 - The client requested the app allow them to create a product, courier, or order and add it to a list, view all products, couriers, or orders, update the status of an order, persist my data for orders,products and couriers to csv's, update or delete a product, order, or courier and be able to view orders by either their assigned courier or order status.

How to run the app
To run the app, open the app package for week 4 and then in your command line interface make sure you current directory is the AppPackage directory, then type in mini-project/week4/source/AppPackage_Week4/masterLoop_module.py and this should run the app.

Unit testing 
There is a test_app.py folder in the apppackage directory which runs test on the user input function which is user through the app in different ways to validate user input.

Project reflection
The project has been challenging but very educational and has allowed me to grow my skills in various data engineering domains. What I have found particularly interesting is how I have over the weeks been able to improve my problem solving skills more and more as I implemented more challenging functionality like working with csv's and being able to alter data, add new data and delete data all while being able to persist that data. Work has began on allowing the app to be able to work with databases as opposed to locally saved files which is another challenging functionality to implement but with my skills in programmatic thinking and problem solving I should be able to do this in no time. Perhaps the most tedious part of the whole project has been error handling especially as the app got more complicated and the functionality increased, each new addition likely caused the app to have an error else where and this was a constant challenge to stay on top of this while advancing the development of the app. In future if I was to do this again, I would lead with TDD (test driven development) to ensure that errors and bugs are handled before they can cause issues down the line, especially I would like in future to implement integration testing throughout the development process. The structure of the app is not the best but not the worst, in future I would love to implement more OOP so that my code is a lot more modularised and make the code a lot clearner and effecient.
